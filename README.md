Absenteeism analysis project aimed to tackle the issue of absenteeismâ€™s impact on organizational productivity. Using a CSV dataset with employee records featuring variables like distance to work, reason for absence, age, transportation expense, body mass index, and pets, conducted data preprocessing using pandas.
This involved loading and exploring the data, handling missing values, removing errors, and transforming and reorganizing the dataset. 

The outcome was a clean, well-organized dataset poised for analysis, providing actionable insights to stakeholders for improving employee attendance and overall productivity.
